## Overview
This assignment consists of several image processing tasks, including filtering, dithering, quantization, and Fourier Transform, implemented using MATLAB and Python. The final results are presented in MATLAB Live Scripts and Python files, demonstrating the effects of these image processing techniques.

## Tasks
1. **Binary Mask and Filters**:
   - Create a binary mask for the region of interest (ROI) and apply low-pass filters (Gaussian and Average) and high-pass filters (Laplacian and Prewitt) using MATLAB.
   
2. **Dithering Algorithms**:
   - Implement and compare the Floyd-Steinberg and Jarvis-Judice-Ninke dithering algorithms using Python.

3. **Kuwahara Filter**:
   - Explain the Kuwahara filter and apply it to an image to demonstrate its effect using Python.

4. **Fourier Transform and Filtering**:
   - Apply the Fourier Transform to an image and implement Butterworth and Gaussian filters in MATLAB or Python.

5. **Quantization**:
   - Take an image and quantize it to 32 grayscale levels using only the `imresize` function in MATLAB, and write down the steps followed.

## Requirements
- **MATLAB** and **Python 3.x**
- Libraries for Python (if used): `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `skimage`
